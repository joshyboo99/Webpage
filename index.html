            <p>We got these totally cool clowns who want to be your friends. Almost nothing goes missing around these two.</p>

            <img src="./images/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-5698363.jpg" alt="An older thin man with white hair and a brown sweater sits upon a grey couch. He has a black headset over his ears and is holding a white xbox 360 controller. in front of him is a large yellow popcorn bucket. An older woman in a tan sweater and tan slacks is bringing a cutting board from the kitchen. the cutting board has a pizza on it. mmmm. their house is in a modern style. grey walls, white cabinets, string lights. clearly they do ok. although this appears to be a fairly traditional pairing, it's strange this older gentleman is playing video games by himself. typically in an image like this there are children playing with the grandparents. This image seems to imply that not only is this the type of man who sits around doing their hobbies while their wife cooks them a meal, but that also this man just sits around playing video games all day. he's clearly of retirement age. were he just watching tv i wouldn't question it, but the video games is strange to me. also there's another cutting board on a shelf in the kitchen. who needs more than one? is the other one retired? why keep it? their kitchen doesn't look especially large. counter space is precious real estate. you've already got a large flower vase on the counter. have you no appliances? who doesn't own a microwave?" height="200"> <!--image by tima-miroshnichenko-->
            <p>We got this guy. He games. Hard. Can't get him to stop. And his person there will bring out whatever food you want. Pizza, asparagus, clapshot, you name it she'll make it.</p>
